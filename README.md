# Description
This program is to determine if the friendship paradox holds for my Facebook
account.* Compute the mean, standard deviation, and median of the
number of friends that my friends have.  Create a graph of the
number of friends (y-axis) and the friends themselves, sorted by
number of friends (x-axis).  (The friends don't need to be labeled
on the x-axis: just f1, f2, f3, ... fn.)
